✅ 1. Functionality Completeness
🔍 Review:

 Can users create, edit, and delete events easily?

 Do recurring events render correctly across days?

 Can events be dragged and dropped across days?

 Are recurrence rules applied correctly on edit?

 Are event conflicts detected and handled?

🧠 Pro Tips:

Implement a "break this instance only" vs "update all recurring" option for recurring events.

Use rrule.js or custom logic to support advanced patterns (e.g., "every 2nd Monday").

Add tooltips on hover showing event info (especially for dense days).

🎨 2. UX / UI Polish
🔍 Review:

 Is the event form intuitive and responsive?

 Do modals/drawers animate in and out smoothly?

 Are event cards visually distinct (colors, tags, icons)?

 Is the current day highlighted clearly?

 Does the calendar adapt to mobile/tablet screens?

🧠 Pro Tips:

Use Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions (modals, drag effects).

Add snackbars/toasts (e.g., “Event created!”) with Undo support.

Use sticky headers and hover/click interactions for delight.

Add a dark mode toggle with persisted theme using Tailwind.

🧠 3. State & Recurrence Logic
🔍 Review:

 Are you storing recurrence rules, not just expanded events?

 Can events be uniquely identified (e.g., recurring event ID + instance ID)?

 Are state updates atomic and undoable?

🧠 Pro Tips:

Structure your recurrence logic like:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  id: 'event-123',
  title: 'Yoga',
  recurrenceRule: 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE',
  exceptions: ['2024-07-03'], // dates excluded
}
Enable "delete only this instance" vs "delete series" behavior.

💾 4. Data Persistence
🔍 Review:

 Are events persisted using IndexedDB or localStorage?

 Does persistence survive refresh and browser reopen?

 Is data structured well for complex queries (e.g., recurring filters)?

🧠 Pro Tips:

Use Dexie.js to simplify IndexedDB logic.

Save timestamps instead of Date objects to avoid timezone bugs.

Add versioning in IndexedDB to support future migrations.

🧲 5. Drag-and-Drop Polish
🔍 Review:

 Can users drag across months/weeks seamlessly?

 Are conflicts detected on drag-drop?

 Does the UI visually respond to drag targets?

🧠 Pro Tips:

Add snap-to-cell and visual placeholders for drop locations.

On drop, confirm if the event is recurring: "Update only this instance or all?"

⚡ 6. Performance & Optimization
🔍 Review:

 Are large numbers of events handled without slowdown?

 Are you avoiding unnecessary re-renders?

🧠 Pro Tips:

Use React.memo or useMemo for static grids.

Virtualize the event list or day column rendering if needed.

Avoid re-parsing recurrence rules on every render; memoize them.
